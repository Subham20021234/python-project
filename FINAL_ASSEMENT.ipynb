    " **Rich Library**: NumPy provides a wide range of mathematical, logical, and statistical functions that are optimized for array operations. These functions enable concise and expressive code for numerical computation tasks.\n",

    "27. Bias and variance are two important concepts in supervised machine learning that help us understand the performance and generalization capabilities of a model.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Bias**:\n",
    "- Bias refers to the error introduced by approximating a real-world problem with a simplified model. It represents the difference between the average prediction of the model and the true value in the data.\n",
    "- A high bias model tends to oversimplify the data and makes strong assumptions about the relationship between features and target, leading to underfitting.\n",
    "- Underfitting occurs when a model is too simple to capture the underlying patterns in the data, resulting in poor performance on both the training and test data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Variance**:\n",
    "- Variance refers to the model's sensitivity to variations in the training data. It measures how much the predictions of the model fluctuate when trained on different subsets of the data.\n",
    "- A high variance model is overly sensitive to the training data and captures noise instead of the true underlying patterns, leading to overfitting.\n",
    "- Overfitting occurs when a model is too complex and captures noise or random fluctuations in the training data, resulting in poor performance on unseen test data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Bias-Variance Tradeoff**:\n",
    "- The bias-variance tradeoff is a fundamental concept in machine learning that deals with the balance between bias and variance in a model.\n",
    "- As the model's complexity increases, its bias decreases (it becomes better at fitting the training data), but its variance increases (it becomes more sensitive to variations in the training data).\n",
    "- Achieving a good tradeoff between bias and variance is essential to build a model that generalizes well to unseen data (test data) and performs well on both the training and test datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Model Evaluation**:\n",
    "- When evaluating a machine learning model, we want to find the optimal balance between bias and variance.\n",
    "- A good model will have low bias and low variance, indicating that it fits the training data well while still generalizing effectively to unseen data.\n",
    "- It is crucial to keep track of both training and test performance while developing models to avoid overfitting (high variance) or underfitting (high bias).\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, bias and variance are two critical aspects of model performance. Bias represents the model's ability to capture the underlying patterns, while variance reflects its sensitivity to variations in the training data. Striking the right balance between bias and variance is vital to build accurate and robust machine learning models."
